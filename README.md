# About This Repository

This repository contains code associated with the HPEC 2023 paper: *Automated Indexing Of TEM Diffraction Patterns Using Machine Learning*. The **/data/** directory contains all test data classification and true labels for each model trained as well as the overall accuracy and F1-score tabular data. The **/figs_and_notebooks/** directory holds two figures from the paper and the Python notebooks used to create them. The **/models/** directory holds the Python scripts used to train and test the models.

# Questions

If you would like the weights for any of the models trained or have further questions, please reach out to Nathaniel Tomczak at nkt8@case.edu.
